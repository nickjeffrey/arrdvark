aRRDvark (Aix Round Robin Database Visualization And Reporting Kit) stores AIX perfomance metrics in RRD files and displays them on a web page



OVERVIEW
--------
aRRDvark (Aix Round Robin Database Visualization And Reporting Toolkit) is a small / lightweight / simple reporting system for AIX.

The typical use case for aRRDvark is quick and easy reporting of performance metrics (CPU, memory, disk, paging, etc) for small AIX environments.

aRRDvark is aimed at small AIX environments (single server, one or just a few LPARs, etc).

aRRDvark is intentionally simple, to avoid the requirement for installing large numbers of binaries on AIX.
In a nutshell, the back-end is written in perl, and the front-end is a javascript-driven web browser interface.
